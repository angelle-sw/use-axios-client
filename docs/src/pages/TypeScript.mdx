# TypeScript

You can use TypeScript to get full type safety in your components. `use-axios-client` ships type definitions, so there's no need to install any `@types` packages.

## Example

1. Define your data response shape:

```ts
interface Data {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

2. Pass it to a hook:

```ts
const { data, error, loading } = useAxios<Data>({
  url: 'https://example/api',
});
```

3. Get type feedback as you develop:

```ts
return <div>{data.location}</div>;
// Property 'location' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'
```
