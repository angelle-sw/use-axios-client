# Server-Side Rendering

If you're using SSR, you can pass in data fetched on the server to initialize the client by using the `ssrData` option.

## Example

```js
const { data, error, loading } = useAxios({
  ssrData: [
    {
      id: '55b797ca21414b0cbad9847ebe6f3d64',
      name: 'Avril Lavigne',
    },
  ],
  url: '/rockstars/2',
});
```
