# Refetching

You can use the `refetch` function provided by the hook to trigger another request at any time.

Common use cases:

- Allow the user to retry a failed request
- Provide the user with a way to refresh data on-demand
- Periodically request new data to keep UI up-to-date

## Example

```jsx
import { useAxios } from 'use-axios-client';

export default () => {
  const { error, refetch } = useAxios({
    url: 'https://example/api',
  });

  if (error) {
    return <Button onClick={() => refetch()}>Retry</Button>;
  }
};
```
