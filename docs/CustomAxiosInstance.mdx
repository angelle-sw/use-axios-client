# Custom Axios Instance

You can define a custom axios instance to be used for the request.

This is useful if your app needs to interact with multiple APIs, each having its own unique set of request options.

## Usage

1. Define your axios instance ([see axios docs](https://github.com/axios/axios#creating-an-instance)):

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://example/api',
  authorization: 'Bearer YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l',
});
```

2. Pass it to a hook using the `axiosInstance` option:

```js
const { data, error, loading } = useAxios({
  axiosInstance: instance,
});
```

All requests made will use the provided axios instance.
